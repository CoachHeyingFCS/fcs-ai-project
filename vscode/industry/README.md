# Retail and E-Commerce Project

This project is designed to showcase a retail and e-commerce website. It includes a main HTML page and additional pages that can be linked to from the main navigation menu.

## Project Structure

- **industry/retailecom.html**: This file contains the main HTML structure for the retail and e-commerce page, including the header, navigation menu, main content, and footer.
- **industry/[newpage].html**: This is a new HTML page that has been added to the project. It follows the same structure as `retailecom.html` and can be modified to include different content as needed.

## Usage

To view the project, open `retailecom.html` in a web browser. You can navigate to the new page by clicking the appropriate link in the menu once it has been added.

## Future Enhancements

- Additional pages can be created following the same structure.
- Styles and scripts can be enhanced to improve the user experience.
- Consider adding more interactive elements or features to engage users.
