							<h3>Overall Use of AI in Video Games</h3>
							<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in video games, primarily by enhancing the behavior of non-playable characters (NPCs), generating dynamic content, and personalizing player experiences. Game AI is distinct from academic AI, focusing more on creating the illusion of intelligence to improve gameplay rather than achieving true machine learning or general intelligence. Techniques like pathfinding, decision trees, behavior trees, and procedural content generation are commonly used to make games more immersive and challenging. In recent years, AI has expanded beyond NPC behavior to include adaptive difficulty systems, real-time content generation, and even emotional responsiveness in characters, transforming how players interact with virtual worlds.</p>
							<h3>1990–2000: Rule-Based Systems and Tactical AI</h3>
							<p>During the 1990s, AI in video games began to mature with the rise of role-playing games (RPGs) and real-time strategy (RTS) titles. Developers implemented rule-based systems and finite-state machines to control NPC behavior. Games like Ultima and Baldur’s Gate featured scripted decision trees that allowed NPCs to react to player actions in basic but engaging ways 2. RTS games such as Dune II and Herzog Zwei struggled with pathfinding and decision-making but laid the groundwork for more sophisticated AI. The concept of tactical AI emerged, allowing players to assign behavioral routines to party members, as seen in Dragon Quest IV and Secret of Mana.</p>
							<h3>2000–2010: Behavior Trees and Procedural Generation</h3>
							<p>The 2000s marked a significant leap in AI sophistication. Developers began using behavior trees and advanced pathfinding algorithms like A* to create lifelike NPCs. Games such as Hitman and F.E.A.R. showcased enemies that could adapt to player strategies, take cover, and coordinate attacks 3. Procedural content generation also gained traction, with titles like Spelunky and Minecraft offering endless replayability through algorithmically generated worlds. AI-driven game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine enabled developers to automate content creation and implement adaptive difficulty systems, making gameplay more dynamic and personalized.</p>
							<h3>2010–2020: Machine Learning and Emotional AI</h3>
							<p>In the 2010s, AI in gaming evolved with the integration of machine learning and deep learning techniques. NPCs began to learn from player behavior, adjusting their strategies in real-time to create more immersive experiences 2. Games like The Last of Us Part II and Red Dead Redemption 2 utilized deep neural networks to deliver emotionally resonant and realistic character interactions. AI also played a role in virtual and augmented reality, powering responsive avatars and dynamic environments. Developers explored natural language processing and emotional intelligence to deepen storytelling and player engagement.</p>
