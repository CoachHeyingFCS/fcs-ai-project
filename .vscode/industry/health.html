							<h1>Impact of AI On Healthcare and Medicine</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Pediatrics. Level of AI Usage: Moderate</h2>
							<p>AI is helping doctors care for children by improving how they diagnose illnesses, manage patient records, and even communicate with families. </p>
							<li>AI is used in pediatric triage systems to quickly assess symptoms and prioritize care, especially in emergency settings.</li>
							<li>Doctors use AI to help with documentation and translation, making it easier to treat children from diverse backgrounds.</li>
							<li>Researchers are also exploring how AI can detect pain in newborns who can't speak, using facial recognition and other signals.</li>
							<X></X></p>
							<h2>Neuroscience. Level of AI Usage: High</h2>
							<p>In brain-related healthcare, AI is helping scientists and doctors understand and treat conditions like stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and paralysis. </p>
							<li>AI-powered tools are being developed to help stroke patients recover at home using virtual reality and brain-computer interfaces.</li>
							<li>Some researchers are using AI to restore speech in people with paralysis by decoding brain signals.</li>
							<li>AI is also helping track eye movements in Parkinson’s patients to detect cognitive decline earlier.</li>

							<br>
							<h2>Cardiology. Level of AI Usage: High</h2>
							<p>AI is transforming heart care by helping doctors detect problems earlier and personalize treatments for better outcomes.</p>
							<li>The American Heart Association funded $10.5 million in research to use AI for improving heart ultrasound scans and CPR techniques.</li>
							<li>AI can now detect hidden signs of kidney and liver disease during heart scans, which helps prevent complications.</li>
							<li>Wearable sensors powered by AI are being tested to guide CPR in real time, improving survival chances during cardiac arrest.</li>

							<br>
							<h2>Oncology (Cancer Care). Level of AI Usage: High</h2>
							<p>AI is being used to detect, diagnose, and treat cancer more accurately and efficiently.</p>
							<li>AI tools are now being integrated into clinical practice to help doctors analyze medical images and genetic data for cancer diagnosis.</li>
							<li>These tools can predict how a patient might respond to treatment, helping doctors choose the best options.</li>
							<li>AI also helps researchers find patterns in huge datasets, speeding up cancer research and improving patient care.</li>
							<br>
							<h2>Radiology. Level of AI Usage: Very High</h2>
							<p>Radiology is one of the first areas where AI has made a big impact, helping doctors read scans faster and more accurately.</p>
							<li>AI systems can detect critical conditions like strokes or blood clots within minutes of a scan being completed.</li>
							<li>A new framework developed at the University of Miami helps hospitals safely integrate AI into radiology workflows.</li>
							<li>These systems also reduce radiologist burnout and improve patient outcomes by speeding up diagnosis and treatment.</li>

							<br>
							<h2>Pathology. Level of AI Usage: Moderate to High</h2>
							<p>Pathology involves studying tissues and cells to diagnose diseases. AI is helping pathologists work faster and more precisely.</p>
							<li>AI tools can analyze blood samples to detect diseases like leukemia in just minutes, which is much faster than traditional methods.</li>
							<li>The College of American Pathologists is working with the FDA and other groups to ensure AI tools are safe and effective.</li>
							<li>AI is also being used in education to help train future pathologists and improve how they learn complex topics.</li>
