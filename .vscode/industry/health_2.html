                <p>Healthcare is a system and the services that maintain and help improve people's physical health and mental well-being.</p>
                <h2>Level of AI Usage:</h2>
                <p>For the most part it is <b>highly</b> used in <u>pathology, neuroscience, cardiology, oncology, and radiology</u>.
                There are a few industries in healthcare that only <b>moderately</b> use artifical intelligence like pediatrics.
                This would be because kids don't need robots or chatbots tending to them, they require human connections to observe them and be around them.</p>

                <h2>Evolution Over Time:</h2>
               
                <b>1950s–1970s: Foundations and Expert Systems</b>
                <p>AI was introduced as a concept by Alan Turing and formally named by John McCarthy.
                    Early medical AI systems like INTERNIST-1 and MYCIN helped diagnose diseases and recommend treatments.
                    These systems used rule-based logic but struggled with uncertainty and scalability.</p>
               
                <b>1980s–1990s: Digital Infrastructure & Imaging:</b>
                <p>AI began supporting radiologists through Computer-Aided Detection (CAD), especially in mammography.
                    Systems like DXplain helped clinicians generate differential diagnoses.
                    AI was also used in ECG analysis and automated blood cell counting.</p>
               
                <b>2000s–2010s: Machine Learning & Big Data:</b>
                <p>AI started analyzing electronic health records (EHRs) to predict hospital readmissions and disease progression.
                    Genomic data integration enabled personalized medicine.
                    IBM Watson gained attention for processing medical literature and assisting clinical decisions.</p>
               
                <b>2020s–Present: Deep Learning & Real-Time Applications:</b>
                <p>Deep learning models now outperform humans in detecting anomalies in medical imaging.
                    Natural Language Processing (NLP) extracts insights from clinical notes and research articles.
                    AI enhances robotic surgery, drug discovery, and remote patient monitoring.
                    Chatbots and virtual assistants improve patient engagement and reduce administrative workload.
                    AI is also used in telemedicine, especially post-COVID, to expand access and improve care delivery.</p>
