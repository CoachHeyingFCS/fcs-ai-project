                            <p>In the 1950s, AI was still a new idea. Computers were just beginning to be used in science, and researchers were exploring how machines could help solve medical problems.</p>
                            <li>The concept of AI was formally introduced at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project in 1956, where scientists imagined machines that could simulate human intelligence.</li>
                            <li>Early medical computing focused on basic tasks like automating patient questionnaires and organizing health data, laying the groundwork for future AI applications.</li>
                            <li>Although AI wasn’t yet practical for medicine, pioneers like Alan Turing and John McCarthy helped shape the vision of intelligent machines that could one day assist doctors.</li>

                            <h2>Bias:</h2>
                            <p>AI is increasingly used in skin cancer detection, particularly for identifying melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Here's how it works—and why bias can emerge:</p>
                            <p><b>How AI Detects Skin Cancer</b></p>
                            <hr>
                            <p>AI systems, especially those based on deep learning, are trained using large datasets of skin lesion images labeled with diagnoses. These systems learn to recognize patterns and features in the images that correlate with different types of skin cancer. Here's a simplified breakdown:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Image Collection: Thousands to millions of dermoscopic or clinical skin images are collected.</li>
                                <li>Labeling: Each image is labeled (e.g., benign, malignant) by dermatologists.</li>
                                <li>Training: AI models (like convolutional neural networks) learn to associate visual features with diagnoses.</li>
                                <li>Prediction: Once trained, the AI can analyze new images and suggest whether a lesion is likely cancerous.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>In clinical settings, AI tools assist dermatologists by flagging suspicious lesions, improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><b>Why AI in Skin Cancer Detection Can Be Biased</b></p>
                            <hr>
                            <p>Despite its promise, AI in dermatology has shown racial and demographic bias, primarily due to issues in data collection and model design:</p>
                            <p>1. Lack of Diversity in Training Data</p>
                            <li>Most datasets (e.g., HAM10000) used to train skin cancer AI models are overwhelmingly composed of images from lighter-skinned individuals.</li>
                            <li>This leads to poor performance when diagnosing lesions on darker skin tones, which can appear differently and are underrepresented in the data.</li>
                            <li>Dermoscopic images (taken with a magnifying device) and clinical photographs are the most common modalities.</li>
                            <li>Some datasets include paired multimodal images (both dermoscopic and clinical), which are more valuable for training robust models.</li>
                            <li>Clinical metadata such as age, skin type, lesion location, and history of melanoma are often included to enhance model performance.</li>
                            <li>Lack of diversity: A major issue is the underrepresentation of darker skin tones. In a review of 21 datasets, only 10 images were of brown skin and 1 of dark brown or black skin.</li>
                            <li>Incomplete metadata: Many datasets lack crucial information like patient ethnicity, skin type, and how images were collected.</li>

                            <p>2. Misclassification Risks</p>
                            <li>AI models trained on biased datasets are more likely to misclassify malignant lesions as benign in people with darker skin, delaying diagnosis and treatment.</li>
                            <li>This is especially concerning because while melanoma is less common in darker-skinned populations, it often has worse outcomes due to late detection.</li>
                            <br>
                            <p>3. Dataset Imbalance</p>
                            <li>Publicly available skin image datasets often lack demographic metadata (e.g., race, ethnicity, skin phototype), making it hard to audit or correct for bias.</li>
                            <li>Even when datasets include diverse images, models may still underperform due to contextual differences in lesion presentation across populations.</li>
                            <br>
                            <p>4. Technical Limitations</p>
                            <li>AI struggles with images that include excessive hair, non-standard lighting, or non-circular lesion shapes, which are more common in real-world settings.</li>

                            <p><b>Efforts to Reduce Bias</b></p>
                            <hr>
                            <p>Some newer models, like SkinWiseNet (SWNet), use techniques like feature fusion—combining insights from multiple diverse datasets—to improve accuracy across skin tones. Others propose frameworks like Predictive Representativity, which focus on fairness in model outcomes rather than just dataset composition .</p>
                            <p>AI models for skin cancer detection are often trained on datasets like HAM10000, which contain mostly images of lighter skin tones—about 95% Fitzpatrick types I–III, and only ~5% representing darker skin (types IV–VI). This imbalance causes the models to underperform for darker skin, misclassifying malignant lesions as benign, which can delay diagnosis and treatment. Even though melanoma is less common in darker skin, mortality is 3.75× higher due to late detection.</p>
                            <p>The lack of skin tone metadata and poor representation in datasets makes it hard for AI to generalize across diverse populations.</p>
                            <p>For fairness, researchers suggest:</p>
                            <li>Using diverse datasets</li>
                            <li>Adopting better skin tone scales like the L’Oréal Color Chart</li>
                            <li>Auditing models with frameworks like Predictive Representativity</li>
                            <br>
                            <p><b>How bias can impact vulnerable populations:</b></p>
                            <hr>
                            <p>AI bias in skin cancer detection can seriously impact vulnerable populations, especially those with darker skin tones. Here are key issues:</p>
                            <li>Delayed or Missed Diagnoses: AI models often misclassify malignant lesions in darker skin as benign, leading to delayed treatment and higher mortality rates.</li>
                            <li>Worse Prognosis: Although melanoma is less common in darker-skinned individuals, they face a 3.75x higher mortality rate due to late detection.</li>
                            <li>Limited Dataset Diversity: Most AI models are trained on images of lighter skin, making them less effective for diagnosing conditions in patients of color.</li>
                            <li>Amplified Bias in Primary Care: AI assistance improves accuracy overall, but primary care physicians—especially those with limited experience treating darker skin—show increased diagnostic bias when using AI tools.</li>
                            <li>Restricted Generalizability: AI models trained on biased datasets fail to perform well in real-world, diverse clinical settings, limiting their usefulness for underserved communities.</li>
